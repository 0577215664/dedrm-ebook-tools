To obtain unencrypted content from the B&N, you have to download it directly from the website. Unrooted Nook devices will not let you save your content to your PC.

If the downloaded file is encrypted, install and configure the ignoble plugin in Calibre to decrypt that.

Some content is not downloadable from the website, for instance magazines. The Greasemonkey script included in the tools modifies the myNook page of the Barnes and Noble website to show a download button for non-downloadable content. This will work until Barnes & Noble changes their website.
